# bitbucket-cascade-merge

This is a web app written in Go that nearly emulates the Bitbucket Server
(Formerly Atlassian Stash) feature [Automatic Branch Merging](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/automatic-branch-merging-776639993.html).
Unfortunately, the cloud version of Bitbucket doesn't have this feature much to the dissatisfaction of the humans 
commenting on the infamous [BCLOUD-14286](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-14286). It works by using Bitbucket 
Cloud Webhooks as well as a little bit of semantic versioning a few API calls. It doesn't automatically merge the branches.
It instead creates pull request with the original author as the reviewer. At Funraise, we use some premium Bitbucket features 
to enforce build checks and some additional sign offs so we prefer just the automatic PR. There is an unused function 
`MergePullRequest` you could probably play around with in `bitbucket.go` if you really wanted to get fully automatic merges. 


Deploy it somewhere like [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-go#deploy-the-app
) and dry those missing feature parity tears.


## Environment Variables

Here are the environment variables you'll need to set:

`RELEASE_BRANCH_PREFIX` - the prefix of the branches you use for your releases. We use `release/` at our shop so our 
release branches look like `release/2020.12.0` the app uses this to look up branches to target PRs against as well as 
for some substitutions in semver.go

`DEVELOPMENT_BRANCH_NAME` - this should typically be `develop`. If you're not using `develop` for your current develop 
branch, I question your life choices, but it's a free country.
 
`BITBUCKET_USERNAME` - Username for bitbucket user that will be doing the API calls and creating the automatic pull 
requests. It's best if this is a non-human user, i.e. a dedicated bitbucket account for builds or bots.

`BITBUCKET_PASSWORD` - Password for bitbucket user that will be doing the API calls and creating the automatic pull 
                     requests. It's best if this is a non-human user, i.e. a dedicated bitbucket account for builds or bots.

`BITBUCKET_SHARED_KEY` - A random UUID or long value to act as an "Api Key" to protect our webhook

## Setting up the Webhook

Once you have your app deployed, go [create a Bitbucket Webhook for your repository](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-webhooks/).
You can configure it to fire on all the triggers under Pull Request at minimum. For the URL, you should input
`https://your-deployed-app-url.yourhost.com?key?={BITBUCKET_SHARED_KEY}`. Replace `{BITBUCKET_SHARED_KEY}` by whatever 
you set for the `BITBUCKET_SHARED_KEY` environment variable. 

## Build
To build and run locally run VS Code "Run-Cascade" configuration.
Make sure environment variables are set correctly in launch.json.
